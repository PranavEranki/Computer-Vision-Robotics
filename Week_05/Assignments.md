# Assignment

## Main
Look at [this](https://github.com/Simon-Hohberg/Viola-Jones) python implementation of the Viola Jones algorithm, and please
examine (and if possible, implement) the source code on your own.

## Challenge 
Based off the detection and training intuition, and possibly any external resources you need, try to implement the algorithm all by yourself.

Obviously, this will be very hard, and will take you a lot of time and thinking. However, it is just a fun little challenge if you are interested.

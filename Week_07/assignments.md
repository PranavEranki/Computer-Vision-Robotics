# Assignments

This is the hardest yet most rewarding assignment so far.

For this week, your task is to first: Examine the *Keypoint CNN* iPython notebook, and determine how that code works. Clarify anything you don't understand through online tools and rigorous testing on your own device.

Then, look at the *Facial Keypoint Detection Final Project - Problem* iPython notebook. Implement __everything__ yourself. It is a task to add a moustache to someone's face in real time using a variety of skills we have learned so far.

If you are confused what something does, just save your code and mess with it! Worst comes to worst, your kernel crashes - your code will remain intact and can be rerun.

If you are done, look at the *Facial Keypoint Detection Final Project - Solution* iPython notebook to make sure your implementation is correct.

__No cheating__ unless you are beyond clueless. If you're stuck, don't give up hope! You genuinely learn a lot through the struggle.

    "We use hsv for range purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes more sense to use HSV instead of RGB for range because for RGB / BGR, each value is a color value (i.e. red, green, blue), so a range of color values does not work. It doesn't make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in HSV, the H (Hue) is the 'color value', the S(Saturation) is how much intensity of that color is present, and the V(Value) is how much of that value is present in the pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three things are all fairly independent, versus with RGB and BGR where the different color values are fairly more dependent on each other and hard to use.\n",

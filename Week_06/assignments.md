# Assignment

Look through the different iPython notebooks, and __implement the code yourself__.

Play with it to __get a feel for how different parameters and filters work__, and how they change your output.

Try and see if you can make __live face detection__, as we only tested face detection on images. If you are confused, refer to how the face detection algorithm works, then see how live input for cv2 works, then merge the two.

If you wish, implement your own versions of this code and __add features as desired__.

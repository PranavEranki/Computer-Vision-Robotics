Feeling hungry for a raw coding challenge and for a great test of all your abilities?

Then attempt to recreate the SSd algorithm in python *on your own*.

I suggest using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, both of which are powerful DL libraries.

I have given my shot at this using TensorFlow, and posted my solution [here](https://github.com/PranavEranki/SSD-Algorithm). However, do NOT look at this link without atleast giving it a solid attempt yourself.

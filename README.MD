# CV Tutorials for Robotics AI Workshop

Welcome to the GitHub repo for the __AI Workshop__ from Cupertino Robotics.

The end goal of this is to turn almost everything which we learn into an *open source
computer vision library*.

__*This will stimulate a 10 Week AI Course*__

<hr/>

## Timeline:

* Week [1](Week_01): Introduction to image I/O, reading writing
* Week [2](Week_02): Thresholding, Filtering
* Week [3](Week_03): Viola Jones Face Detection Algorithm
* Week [4](Week_04): Understanding Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
* Week [5](Week_05): Understanding CNNs, then implementing them for MNIST
* Week [6](Week_06): Blurring, Edge Detection, and Face Detection
* Week [7](Week_07): Live Facial Key point Detection
* Week [8](Week_08): SSD object detection algorithm intuition
* Week [9](Week_09): Semantic Segmentation Intuition
* Week [10](Week_10): Neural Style Transfer Intuition, Package Open-Sourcing

If you are still confused, go to [this](https://medium.com/tensorflow/neural-style-transfer-creating-art-with-deep-learning-using-tf-keras-and-eager-execution-7d541ac31398) link for a good explanation. Make sure you understand fully before proceeding.

Go to [this](https://github.com/PranavEranki/Style-Transfer) link for a completed project utilizing Neural Style Transfer.

Try and do this project by yourself or replicate Neural Style Transfer by yourself. There are many online tutorials that will go through NSS step by step, as it is a widely recognized, popular algorithm.

__Now, our major project:__ All along this workshop series, we have been building up to this.
Take all of your completed functions, code pieces, and such so far and turn this into an open source library!

For a few more instructions, refer to [this](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Week_10/Open%20Sourcing.ipynb) document.

__GOOD LUCK, AND HAPPY CODING!!__

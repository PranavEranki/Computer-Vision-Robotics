In the project folder, you will find a completed semantic segmentation project on Road Segmentation.

This is a NN to label the pixels of a road in images using an  FCN-VGG16.

Although it is difficult to do so, __attempt to do the segmentation project__ on your own.

If you cannot, atleast __go through the github project__ and examine the code, and most importantly *read and understand* the readme file, which contains a lot of useful info to keep in mind and learn from.
